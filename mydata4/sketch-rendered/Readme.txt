Since the original sketches are stored in vector graphics, they can be rendered with different stroke width. Different width serves different purposes in this work.
- Width 1 is used for quantitative evaluation, and perceptual study for boundary detection results
- Width 3 is the width when the sketches are recorded and is used for visualization
- Width 5 is used for training our model, and perceptual study for our results
